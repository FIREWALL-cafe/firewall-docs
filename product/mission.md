## Pitch

Firewall Cafe is a web application that helps researchers, journalists, educators, and students understand internet censorship by providing side-by-side search result comparisons between Google and Baidu with geographic visualization and analytics.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Academic Researchers**: Scholars studying internet censorship, digital rights, and information control
- **Journalists**: Reporters investigating censorship stories and international information access
- **Educators & Students**: Teachers and learners exploring digital literacy and global information systems

### User Personas

**Academic Researcher** (25-55 years old)
- **Role:** University Professor or Research Fellow
- **Context:** Conducting studies on internet freedom, digital rights, or comparative media systems
- **Pain Points:** Difficulty accessing comparative search data, lack of visualization tools for censorship patterns, time-intensive manual research
- **Goals:** Publish research on information control, visualize censorship patterns, access reliable comparative data

**Investigative Journalist** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Staff Reporter or Freelance Journalist
- **Context:** Investigating stories related to information control, government censorship, or digital rights
- **Pain Points:** Limited access to censored content comparison, difficulty demonstrating censorship to audiences, lack of visual evidence
- **Goals:** Produce compelling stories with data-driven evidence, access censored vs uncensored content, create visual proof of information gaps

## The Problem

### Limited Censorship Visibility

Internet users and researchers lack easy access to comparative search results that reveal how different search engines filter or present information differently based on geographic and political contexts. This information asymmetry makes it difficult to understand the true scope of internet censorship.

**Our Solution:** Provide real-time side-by-side search comparisons with geographic tracking and visualization tools.

### Research Accessibility Barriers

Academic research on internet censorship requires significant technical resources and time to gather comparative data across different search engines and regions.

**Our Solution:** Democratize access to censorship research tools through an intuitive web interface with built-in analytics.

### Lack of Educational Resources

Students and educators need accessible tools to understand and demonstrate how internet censorship works in practice across different countries and systems.

**Our Solution:** Create an educational platform that visualizes censorship patterns through interactive maps and comparative analytics.

## Differentiators

### Real-Time Comparative Analysis

Unlike static research reports or academic papers, we provide live, real-time comparisons between Google and Baidu search results with immediate visual differences highlighted.

### Geographic Intelligence Integration

Unlike simple search comparison tools, we integrate IP geolocation tracking and geographic heatmaps to show censorship patterns across different regions and countries.

### Educational Accessibility

Unlike complex research tools requiring technical expertise, we provide an intuitive interface designed for educators, students, and general users to easily understand and explore censorship concepts.
