## 2025-08-16: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Firewall Cafe will focus on providing accessible, real-time search comparison tools between Google and Baidu to help researchers, journalists, and educators understand internet censorship patterns through interactive visualizations and geographic analysis.

### Context

Internet censorship research is currently limited by technical barriers and lack of accessible comparison tools. Academic researchers and journalists need better ways to visualize and understand how search engines filter information differently across regions. The market opportunity exists in democratizing access to censorship research tools while maintaining academic rigor.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Static Research Platform**
   - Pros: Simpler to build, academic credibility, focused scope
   - Cons: Limited real-time value, reduced user engagement, narrow audience

2. **Comprehensive Censorship Monitoring**
   - Pros: Broader market appeal, multiple revenue streams, extensive data
   - Cons: Complex to build, regulatory concerns, resource intensive

3. **Educational Tool Only**
   - Pros: Clear mission, educational market, simpler features
   - Cons: Limited scalability, narrow user base, funding challenges

### Rationale

The chosen approach balances accessibility with depth, serving both academic and general audiences. Real-time comparison provides immediate value while geographic visualization makes complex censorship patterns understandable. The Google vs Baidu focus provides clear differentiation while remaining technically feasible.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear value proposition for multiple user segments
- Technical feasibility with existing APIs and tools
- Educational impact and research value
- Potential for academic partnerships and credibility

**Negative:**
- Dependence on external APIs (Google, Baidu)
- Potential political sensitivity around censorship research
- Complex geographic data requirements
- Need for ongoing content moderation and expert validation

## 2025-08-16: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use React 18.2.0 with Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and Google Cloud Platform for hosting to ensure scalability, maintainability, and reliable API integration.

### Context

The application requires real-time search processing, complex data visualization, and geographic analysis capabilities. The stack must support rapid development while ensuring production reliability for research-grade data handling.

### Rationale

React provides excellent visualization component support (React Simple Maps, Chart.js). Express.js enables flexible API integration with Google and Baidu services. PostgreSQL offers robust data storage for search archives and analytics. GCP provides comprehensive hosting with database and storage integration.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Proven stack with extensive community support
- Excellent visualization library ecosystem
- Reliable API integration capabilities
- Scalable cloud infrastructure

**Negative:**
- Dependency on GCP vendor lock-in
- Requires team expertise in full JavaScript stack
- Ongoing cloud hosting costs
